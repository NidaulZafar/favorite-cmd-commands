## echo "text here" >> `<filename>`
This command is useful if you want to add some text in a file. I find this useful to make notes. Whenever I have to add a new note I dont need to open the file, write the note, save it and then close the file. I can do all this with just a few words commands in CLI.
## touch `<filename>`
This is a simpler process to create a new file. Nowadays we daily have to create new files related to HTMl, CSS and other stuff like markdown and github. The above line of code makes it easier to create new files.
## mkdir -p i/created/this/nested/path
This is also a handy line of code with which I can easily create paths where I want to store a file.
